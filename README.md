The data structure is a graph. Each node of the graph represents a destination that user want to visit. Each edge represents the distance of the two locations.

To run the program, just execute the Interface.py. There will be three choice for user: tour guide system, local restaurant recommendation system, or exit

In the tour guide system, user will choose the destinations from the University of Michigan. There are totally 25 destinations but to get results real quick it is better to only choose 10 or less destinations. After user choose the point to start, the shortest path and distance will be output

In the local restaurant recommendation system, user could input the sorting requirement, number of results to show, and the food category to search. The results will show the restaurants list. User could choose to see their webpages in the browser.
